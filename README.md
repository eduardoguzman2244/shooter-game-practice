Shooter Game Practice
Small project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to move, shoot, and defeat the enemies while avoiding their shots.
Each enemy you destroy gives you points, you start with 3 lives, and a final boss appears when you beat the first one.
If you lose all your lives, it’s game over — if you beat the boss, you win.
